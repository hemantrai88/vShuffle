## Installing {{site.project_title}} {#installing-polymer}

If you're ready to start your own project, you can install {{site.project_title}}
in one of several ways:

*   Bower. **Recommended**. Bower manages dependencies, so installing a component
    also installs any missing dependencies. Bower also handles updating
    installed components. For more information, see [Installing with Bower](#using-bower).

*   ZIP file. Includes all dependencies, so you can unzip it and start using it
    immediately. The ZIP file requires no extra tools, but doesn't provide a
    built-in method for updating dependencies. For more information, see
    [Installing from ZIP files](#using-zip).

*   GitHub. When you clone a component from GitHub, you need to manage all of the dependencies
    yourself.

When you install {{site.project_title}} using Bower, you get the
[Web Components polyfill library](/0.5/docs/start/platform.html). 
For this version of {{site.project_title}}, you need the `webcomponents-lite` version of the 
library, which doesn't include the shadow DOM polyfill.

Using the polyfills ensures that you can use {{site.project_title}} with browsers that don't support
the Web Components specifications natively.

## Installing with Bower {#using-bower}

The recommended way to install **{{site.project_title}} {% polymer_version_dir %}**
is through Bower. To install Bower, see the [Bower web site](http://bower.io/).

Bower removes the hassle of dependency management when developing or consuming
elements. When you install a component, Bower makes sure any dependencies are
installed as well.

### Project setup

If you haven't created a `bower.json` file for your application, run this
command from the root of your project:

    bower init

This generates a basic `bower.json` file. Some of the questions, like
"What kind of modules do you expose," can be ignored by pressing Enter.

The next step is to install {{site.project_title}}:

    bower install --save Polymer/polymer#^0.9.0

Bower adds a `bower_components/` folder in the root of your project and
fills it with {{site.project_title}} and its dependencies.

**Tip:** `--save` adds the item as a dependency in *your* app's bower.json:
```
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "polymer": "Polymer/polymer#^0.9.0
  }
}
```
{: .alert .alert-success }

#### Updating packages {#updatebower}

When a new version of {{site.project_title}} is available, run `bower update`
in your app directory to update your copy:

    bower update

This updates all packages in `bower_components/` to the latest stable version.

## Installing from ZIP files {#using-zip}

Click the button to download {{site.project_title}} {% polymer_version_dir %} as a ZIP file.

<p><a href="http://zipper.bowerarchiver.appspot.com/archive?polymer=Polymer/polymer%230.9.0">
  <paper-button class="cta" raised><core-icon icon="file-download"></core-icon>Download ZIP</paper-button>
</a></p>

When you download {{site.project_title}} as a ZIP file, you get all of
the dependencies bundled into a single archive. It's a great way to get
started because you don't need to install any additional tools.

Expand the ZIP file in your project directory to create a `bower_components` folder.

![](/{% polymer_version_dir %}/images/zip-file-contents.png)

Unlike Bower, the ZIP file doesn't provide a built-in method
for updating dependencies. You can manually update components with a new ZIP
file. 

**Note:**  If you decide to install Bower later, you can use Bower to update the 
components you installed from the ZIP file. Follow the instructions in 
[Updating packages](#updatebower).

## Using git {#git}

Because there are a number of dependencies we suggest you install
{{site.project_title}} with Bower instead of git. If you'd like to hack on
the project or submit a pull request, you can [visit the GitHub repo](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer).

## Next steps {#nextsteps}
